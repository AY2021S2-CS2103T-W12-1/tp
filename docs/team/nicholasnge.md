## Project: DocBob

DocBob is a patient management application for Doctors to manage patient information, upcoming appointments and medical records. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**: Suite of appointment functionality (Pull Requests [\#25](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/25))
  * What it does: Add appointment commands and JSON storage of it.
  * Justification: This is one whole arm of our app's functionality
  * Highlights: everything in appointments

* **New Feature**: Suite of medical record functionality. (Pull Request [\#30](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/30))
  * What it does: All the medical record funtionality including add medical record, view medical record, add section, save medical record, JSON storage related to nested medical records and sections, the huge chunk of JavaFX I had to fight through to make the separate windows... its quite a lot ill just lump it all under this one feature.
  * Justification: This is another whole arm of our app's functionality.
  * Highlights: everything in medical records, including the separate windows

* **New Features**: JavaFX (Pull Request [\#42](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/42))
  * What it does: Looks better
  * Highlights: I know JavaFX is not heavily graded on, but in this case our JavaFX adds quite abit to our functionality, like the adding of the view patient box and new windows for medical records etc, quite important for our features to work.
